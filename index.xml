      <description>About This AutoHotkey script creates a system-wide hotkey for accessing the mintty terminal as a dropdown console, as popularized by the PC game, Quake&amp;trade;.
I started development on this back in 2011, originally forking it from marcharding&amp;rsquo;s 75-line implemention. It has since grown to 620+ lines (and counting!).
Life events got in the way and I had to stop development on it for a number of years. However, with the release of Windows Subsystem for Linux and especially wsltty, I have resumed work on this project.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m glad that you asked! You see, back in the early days of online gaming, I used the handle, Lone_Wolf. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t long until I found out that many other people were using that handle as well. I needed something unique. Pie happens to be one of my favourite things. The rest, as they say, is history.
About me  I have a decade of professional web development experience and a lifetime of general computer experience (I was practically raised by my computer).</description>
